Heart disease is a term relating to several conditions affecting the heart, such as coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, congenital heart defects and heart valve disease. These can result in heart attacks, anginas or strokes. Some common symptoms of heart disease are shortness of breath, bradycardia, tachycardia, dizziness and fatigue. 

Many of these problems are related to a process called atherosclerosis, the buildup of fatty deposits in the walls of arteries. Atherosclerotic fatty deposits (plaque) narrows the diameter of the artery which results in reduced blood flow. 

The predictive question we aim to answer through this project is: If a patient of age greater than sixty years is admitted to the hospital with a resting blood pressure greater than the average (___), what will the patientâ€™s heart disease diagnosis be?
